- 👋 Hi, I’m @strangezuffi
- 👀 I’m interested in keeping my kids alive, honing ABAP skills, and sneaking in as much sleep as possible
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Git, and when I've managed that, I'll start programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm not very helpful right now
- 📫 How to reach me? Git, I suppose.
